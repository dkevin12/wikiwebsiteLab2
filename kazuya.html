    <h3>Origins and Background</h3>
    <p>Kazuya Mishima first appeared in the original Tekken (1994) as the protagonist seeking revenge against his father, Heihachi Mishima, who infamously threw him off a cliff as a child to test his strength.
      Surviving the fall through sheer will, and later through a deal with a demonic entity, Kazuya was reborn with supernatural powers fueled by hatred.
      His reappearance in Tekken 2 marked a turning point: no longer a victim, but a ruthless anti-hero who would mirror his father’s cruelty.
      The cyclical nature of violence in the Mishima family became one of the series’ defining storylines, emphasizing power, betrayal, and generational trauma.
    </p>

    <h2>Playstyle</h2>
    <p>Kazuya’s playstyle relies heavily on controlling neutral space with powerful mid attacks and punishes.
      His <strong>Electric Wind God Fist (EWGF)</strong> is one of the most iconic moves in fighting game history,
      offering fast startup, frame advantage, and combo potential when executed consistently.
      While creating a high-risk, high-reward mixup while performing his highly advanced <strong> Wave Dash</strong> that allows him to use his entire moveset when perfected

**Kazuya Mishima** is one of the central and most complex characters in the *Tekken* fighting game franchise developed by **Bandai Namco Entertainment**. Known for his stoic demeanor, demonic power, and deep-seated resentment toward his father, Heihachi Mishima, Kazuya represents a recurring theme of vengeance and corruption within the Mishima bloodline. His story explores the blurred line between humanity and evil, as he grapples with both the **Devil Gene** and the weight of his family legacy.

## Section 1: Origins and Background

Kazuya Mishima first appeared in the original *Tekken* (1994) as the protagonist seeking revenge against his father, **Heihachi Mishima**, who infamously threw him off a cliff as a child to test his strength. Surviving the fall through sheer will, and later through a deal with a demonic entity, Kazuya was reborn with supernatural powers fueled by hatred.

His reappearance in *Tekken 2* marked a turning point: no longer a victim, but a ruthless anti-hero who would mirror his father’s cruelty. The cyclical nature of violence in the Mishima family became one of the series’ defining storylines, emphasizing **power, betrayal, and generational trauma**.
